# Button Pushes Count
## AIM:
To count number of button pushes using arduino

## Purpose:
Cout the number of button pushes to perform respective actions

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- Button
(Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:
- First we initialise the button push value
- We initiate a loop
- A delay is added so that push can be counted

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of the button to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/pragyakhanna11/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/Alternate%20LED%20Blinking/alternate_led_blinking.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
