## AIM:
To count number of button pushes using arduino

## Purpose:
Count the number of button pushes to perform respective actions

## Short Description:
**Requirements:**
- Arduino UNO
- Button

## Workflow:

- We initiate a loop
- A delay is added so that push can be counted

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of the button to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/Soumya-Kushwaha/IoT-Projects-and-Scripts/blob/c8c09ef6d29163d6d019be86692f6a204fa950fe/Arduino%20Projects/Button%20Pushes%20Count/Button%20Push%20Count.cpp)
- Run to see the project in action!
